 ## Project Goal
 This project simulates a real-world business scenario where I will analyze 
transactional, behavioral, and geolocation data to generate actionable insights that 
support strategic decision-making in areas like customer experience, sales optimization, 
delivery logistics, and product performance.


 ## Project Objectives
 1. Customer Insights:
  - Analyze purchasing behavior by city/state.
 - Identify customer retention or churn patterns.
 - Segment customers by purchase frequency and order value.
   
 2. Sales Performance Analysis:
- Determine top-performing product categories, sellers, and regions.
  
 - Identify trends in payment methods and revenue streams.
   
 - Correlate lead qualification to closed deals and revenue outcomes.
   
 3. Delivery & Logistics: 
- Compare estimated vs. actual delivery dates to measure delivery efficiency.

- Highlight cities or states with frequent delays.
  
 4. Review & Satisfaction Insights:
- Analyze the distribution of review scores by product category or seller.
-  Determine if longer delivery times impact review sentiment.
  
5. Additional Analysis Areas:
 - Geospatial visualization of seller vs. customer locations to suggest delivery
 optimization.
 - Create a dashboard to track business KPIs using Power BI, Tableau, or Python Dash. I'm using Python Dash
 - Suggest A/B test opportunities from the funnel or product level.

## Analysis Findings
 ### Customer Insights
 **Purchasing Behavior by City/State:**
 
 The analysis of customer purchasing behavior by city and state reveals that the state of 
São Paulo (SP) and its capital city, São Paulo, are the leading regions in terms of 
purchase volume. This indicates a high concentration of customers and economic 
activity in these areas. Other significant regions include Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Belo 
Horizonte (MG).

 **Customer Purchase Frequency:**
 
 While most customers make a single purchase, there are instances of repeat buyers. The 
customer with the unique ID 8d50f5eadf50201ccdcedfb9e2ac8455 has made the 
highest number of purchases (17 orders), indicating a highly engaged customer. 
Identifying and understanding the behavior of such frequent buyers can be crucial for 
retention strategies.

 **Customer Segmentation by Order Value:**
 
 Analyzing customer spending habits shows a wide range in total expenditure. The top
spending customer (0a0a92112bd4c708ca5fde585afaa872) has spent significantly 
more than others, with a total of 13664.08. This highlights the importance of identifying 
and nurturing high-value customers through targeted marketing and loyalty programs.

 ## Sales Performance Analysis
 
 **Top-Performing Product Categories by Revenue:**
 
Health_beauty and watches_gifts are the top-performing product categories in terms 
of total revenue, significantly contributing to the overall sales. This suggests strong 
market demand and potential for further investment in these categories.

**Top-Performing Sellers by Revenue:**

 Several sellers stand out with high revenue generation. The seller with ID 
4869f7a5dfa277a7dca6462dcf3b52b2 leads in total revenue, indicating their 
effectiveness in sales and potentially a strong product portfolio or customer base.

 **Payment Methods and Revenue Streams:**
 
 Credit card payments dominate the revenue streams, accounting for the largest portion 
of total revenue. Boleto and voucher payments also contribute significantly, highlighting 
the diverse payment preferences of customers.


## Lead Qualification to Closed Deals and Revenue Outcomes:

 The conversion rate from qualified leads to closed deals is approximately (10.58%). 
The total declared monthly revenue from closed leads is substantial, at 840. 
This indicates that while the conversion rate might seem low, the value of each closed 
deal is high, making lead nurturing and conversion optimization critical.

 ## Delivery & Logistics
 
 **Delivery Efficiency and Delays:**
 
 Out of 99,440 total orders, 5,535 orders (approximately 5.57%) experienced delivery 
delays. This suggests an area for improvement in logistics and delivery management to 
enhance customer satisfaction.

 ## Review & Satisfaction Insights
 
 **Distribution of Review Scores:**
 
 The majority of reviews are positive, with 5-star ratings accounting for approximately 
57.77% of all reviews. This indicates a generally high level of customer satisfaction. 
However, there are still a notable percentage of 1-star and 2-star reviews, which warrant 
further investigation to identify underlying issues
